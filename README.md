#  Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Mining (EDA-DM)

##  Project Overview

This project explores the diabetes dataset through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applies **Data Mining** techniques to extract patterns, discover clusters, and evaluate insights. The goal is to understand the data deeply before modeling.

##  Main Tasks

-  **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Univariate and bivariate analysis
  - Histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps
-  **Feature Engineering**:
  - Encoding, scaling, new feature construction
-  **Data Mining Techniques**:
  - Association rules (Apriori)
